# XML to HTML Table Conversion

This HTML script transforms XML data from the "book2.xml" file into an HTML table. The provided JavaScript code utilizes XMLHttpRequest to fetch the XML content and then dynamically generates an HTML table with relevant book details.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have [Wampserver](http://www.wampserver.com/) installed on your system.

## Instructions

1. Place both the HTML file (`index.html`) and the "book2.xml" file in the `www` folder of Wampserver.
2. Start Wampserver and ensure it's running.
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
## Usage

The HTML page will display a table containing book details sourced from the "book2.xml" file.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file with JavaScript code for XML to HTML table conversion.
- `book2.xml`: Sample XML file containing book details.

## Example

Open the HTML file through Wampserver in a web browser, and the table with book details will be rendered.

Feel free to modify the XML file or customize the HTML code to suit your specific needs.
```

This version emphasizes placing both files in the `www` folder of Wampserver for seamless execution.
